# Flow engine (M2)

A **flow** is a GRAPH of steps a task walks through. Where the M0 "solo" flow is
one agent run, a multi-step flow chains several agent turns — plan, build, critic,
a human gate — that all **share one worktree**. Flows are a graph, not a line:
successors are a set and a gate routes by the human's answer, so a flow can loop
(TDD critic → redo).

Code: `internal/flow` (the graph model + presets + YAML), `internal/orchestrator`
(the runner that walks it), `internal/store` + `internal/core` (run persistence),
`web/src/components/FlowStepper.tsx` (the card's live stepper).

## Model

A `Step` is `{id, role, agent, prompt, gate, next[], routes[]}`:

- **work step** (`gate:false`) — runs `agent` (or the task's agent) in the shared
  worktree, seeded with `prompt`; when the agent ends its turn it advances along
  `next[0]`. An empty `next` is terminal → the task goes to review.
- **gate step** (`gate:true`) — runs no agent. It parks the task as `needs_human`
  via the ordinary `ask_human` mechanism. The human's answer is routed through
  `routes[]` (answer substring → next step); the first route is the default
  (approve). A route to `""` finishes the flow (→ review).

`Flow = {key, label, start, steps[]}`. Presets ship in code and double as
templates; a project can override or add flows in `.ultraflow/flows.yaml` (parsed
by `flow.ParseYAML`, layered by `flow.Load`). Only **wired** flows (`flow.Wired`)
are selectable — task creation normalizes anything else to solo, and the composer
shows the rest as "· soon" (presentation honesty).

Shipped: `solo`, `plan-build`, `plan-build-critic-gate`.

## Runner (orchestrator)

`start()` creates the worktree **once**, then branches: a single-step flow keeps
the unchanged solo path (so the default can't regress); a multi-step flow enters
`runFlow`, which walks the graph from the persisted cursor:

1. **enter step** → persist the cursor (publishes live progress over SSE).
2. **gate** → `openGate` posts the checkpoint and the goroutine returns (freeing
   its concurrency slot). The answer re-enters via `AnswerHuman → Reengage →
   resumeGate`, routed by the answer (approve → finish; reject → loop back,
   seeding the feedback into the rebuild).
3. **work step** → `runStep` runs one agent turn. A clean turn end (finish_task,
   an idle turn-end, or a clean exit) advances the graph; a crash self-heals in
   place up to the budget, then escalates as a `needs_human` item (resumed by
   `resumeStep`, which keeps walking the flow rather than returning to review).

`finish_task` is flow-aware via `core.CompleteTurn`: a solo task goes straight to
review, a mid-flow step only marks its turn done (the card never flashes to review
between steps).

## Persistence & resume

One `runs` row per multi-step task: `flow, cursor, completed[], phase, turn_done`.
The explicit persisted phase is `pending`, `active`, `waiting`, or `complete`.
Recovery cold-starts a pending step, but resumes an interrupted active step's
session with a compact continuation prompt. Gates and escalations remain waiting;
only an active step can accept `finish_task`, so a late call from an old agent
cannot advance a newer cursor. The cursor is persisted every step, so
`RecoverInFlight` resumes at that step — the run row is kept, not cleared. The
board reads `RunProgress` (index, total, sub-agent, gate, caption)
from the cursor + graph; the card's stepper lights the live step and captions it
("Build · step 2 of 4 · critic + your gate next").

## Failure self-heal

Per spec.md "Failure self-heals": a step error auto-diagnoses and retries up to N
(per-task budget) while the card stays `running` with a `fixing itself · k/N`
sub-state, before escalating to the human. Same policy as solo, applied per step.
